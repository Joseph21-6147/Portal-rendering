# Portal-rendering

A series of progressive implementations based on the Portal Rendering video by Bisqwit (see: https://youtu.be/HQYsFshbkYw)

The series is progressive - each next implementation builds upon the previous one. To best understand the code I advise to start at the first implementation (that is part 1a - Setup and datastructures), and work your way through the series. You can use a difference analysis tool (like WinMerge) to pinpoint the addition of each implementation in comparison with the previous one. It helps of course if you check out the Bisqwit video while looking through the code.

In each cpp file I added a short description where I summarize what that particular part is about.

There are a few dependencies:

1. all implementations are built upon the olcPixelGameEngine.h header file by JavidX9 - see: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine
2. for most of the implementations you need some map file. I enclosed the Bisqwit map in the repo, but you can use your own if you want. Adapt the file name in the code to this end.


NOTE: the code contains bugs and shows glitches in the rendering. If you have ideas how to solve these, you are more than welcome!


Have fun with it!
