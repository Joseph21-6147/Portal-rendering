# Portal-rendering

A series of progressive implementations based on the Portal Rendering video by Bisqwit (see: https://youtu.be/HQYsFshbkYw)

The series is progressive - each next implementation builds upon the previous one. So in order to understand the code, I advise to start at the first implementation (that is part 1a - Setup and datastructures), and work your way through the series. It helps of course if you check out the Bisqwit video while looking through the code.

In each cpp file I added a short description where I summarize what that particular part is about.

There are a few dependencies:

all implementations are built upon the olcPixelGameEngine.h header file by JavidX9 - see: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine
for most of the implementations you need some map file. I enclosed the Bisqwit map in the repo, but you can use your own if you want. Adapt the file name in the code to this end.

Have fun with it!
